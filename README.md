# LPC812 Simple Breakout

This is a near-minimal breakout board for LPC812 microcontroller (SOIC-14W variant, LPC812M101JD20).
MCU has ARM Cortex-M0+ core (30MHz), 16KiB flash, 4KiB RAM. Supply voltage 1.8V - 3.6V.

Breakout includes:
* All 20 pins.
* RESET button.
* ISP button (must be held during reset, released shortly after) to enter bootloader mode (activates USART on PIO0_0 = RXD, PIO0_4 = TXD for programming).
